Once we have the plugin created and ready to go,
We want to create a themes file inside our src folder. you can name it Whatever you want. 

the code is verbose, but let this serve as a cheat sheet. https://hslpicker.com/ is a pretty good HSL picker!

Checkout the SashaTheme.js file to see the attributes we define.

once we get the file created, we want to go to our plugin file and import theme from the theme file.

then we want to run our configUpdate function on the manager parameter. Like so:

manager.updateConfig({colorTheme: SashaTheme});
